# Notes #

Please be patient when you load these pages. They have a lot of `iframe`s and so it can take some time to get them downloaded and rendered.

Also, you want to use a modern browser like the latest version of Mozilla Firefox for best experience. I have tested these pages using Firefox version 3.5.

To generated these pages, I used the `TOhtml` command in the Vim 7.2 distribution to generate the html files inside the `iframe`s. The Perl script that I use to generate them is in the Subversion repository.

I also maintain a similar project for GNU Emacs [here](http://code.google.com/p/gnuemacscolorthemetest/).

# Color Themes #

The color schemes used in this page are available in the [scripts section](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?keywords=&script_type=color+scheme&order_by=creation_date&direction=descending&search=search) of www.vim.org.

The actual color scheme files I used are available as local copies and are linked inside these pages for the record. Note that I may not have downloaded the most recent version of the color schemes available.
